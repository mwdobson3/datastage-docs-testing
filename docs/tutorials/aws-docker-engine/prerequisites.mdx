# Prerequisites and Setup

⏱️ **Duration:** 10 minutes

Before deploying a DataStage Remote Engine on AWS with Docker, ensure you have all the necessary accounts, tools, and permissions.

## Required Accounts

### AWS Account
You need an AWS account with permissions to:
- Create and manage EC2 instances
- Configure security groups
- Attach and manage EBS volumes
- Generate and use SSH key pairs

:::tip
If you're an IBMer, you can use [IBM TechZone](https://techzone.ibm.com/) to provision AWS resources for testing.
:::

### IBM Cloud Account
You need an IBM Cloud account with:
- Access to Cloud Pak for Data
- A DataStage project created
- Permissions to create Remote Engines

## Required Tools

### SSH Client
You'll need an SSH client to connect to your EC2 instance:

**macOS/Linux:**
```bash
# SSH is pre-installed, verify with:
ssh -V
```

**Windows:**
- Use Windows Terminal with OpenSSH
- Or install [PuTTY](https://www.putty.org/)

### IBM Cloud CLI (Optional)
While not required for this tutorial, the IBM Cloud CLI can be helpful:

```bash
# macOS
brew install ibmcloud-cli

# Linux
curl -fsSL https://clis.cloud.ibm.com/install/linux | sh

# Windows
# Download from: https://github.com/IBM-Cloud/ibm-cloud-cli-release/releases/
```

## Required Information

Before starting, gather the following information:

### IBM Cloud Information

1. **IBM Cloud API Key**
   - Navigate to [IBM Cloud API Keys](https://cloud.ibm.com/iam/apikeys)
   - Click "Create an IBM Cloud API key"
   - Save the key securely

2. **IBM Cloud Container Registry API Key**
   - Same as your IBM Cloud API key
   - Used to pull DataStage container images

3. **Project ID**
   - Open your Cloud Pak for Data project
   - Find the Project ID in the project settings

### AWS Information

1. **SSH Key Pair**
   - Create or use an existing EC2 key pair
   - Download the `.pem` file
   - Keep it secure

2. **Preferred AWS Region**
   - Choose a region close to your data
   - Example: `us-east-1`, `us-west-2`, `eu-west-1`

## EC2 Instance Requirements

Your EC2 instance should meet these minimum specifications:

| Requirement | Specification |
|------------|---------------|
| **Operating System** | RHEL 9.3 or later |
| **Instance Type** | t3.large or larger (2 vCPU, 8 GB RAM minimum) |
| **Root Volume** | 30 GB minimum |
| **Secondary Volume** | 100 GB minimum (for Docker storage) |
| **Network** | Public IP address for SSH access |

:::info Recommended Instance Types
- **Development/Testing**: `t3.large` (2 vCPU, 8 GB RAM)
- **Production**: `t3.xlarge` or larger (4 vCPU, 16 GB RAM)
:::

## Storage Configuration

The DataStage Remote Engine requires significant storage for:
- Container images (~10-15 GB)
- Job execution data
- Temporary files
- Logs

**Storage Strategy:**
- **Root Volume** (`/`): Operating system and applications
- **Secondary Volume** (`/mnt/data`): Docker storage and container data

:::warning Important
Always use a secondary volume for Docker storage to prevent filling up the root filesystem.
:::

## Network Requirements

### Inbound Rules (Security Group)
Your EC2 instance needs these inbound rules:

| Type | Protocol | Port | Source | Purpose |
|------|----------|------|--------|---------|
| SSH | TCP | 22 | Your IP | SSH access |

### Outbound Rules
Your EC2 instance needs outbound access to:
- **IBM Cloud**: `*.cloud.ibm.com` (HTTPS/443)
- **Container Registry**: `icr.io` (HTTPS/443)
- **Package Repositories**: For installing software

## Pre-Deployment Checklist

Before proceeding to the next step, verify you have:

- [ ] AWS account with EC2 permissions
- [ ] IBM Cloud account with Cloud Pak for Data access
- [ ] IBM Cloud API key created and saved
- [ ] IBM Cloud Container Registry API key (same as API key)
- [ ] Cloud Pak for Data project created
- [ ] Project ID noted
- [ ] SSH client installed and working
- [ ] AWS SSH key pair created and downloaded
- [ ] Preferred AWS region selected
- [ ] Understanding of storage requirements

## Next Steps

Once you have all prerequisites ready, proceed to:

**[Launch and Configure EC2 Instance →](/docs/tutorials/aws-docker-engine/launch-ec2)**

## Troubleshooting

### Can't Create IBM Cloud API Key

**Problem:** Don't have permissions to create API keys

**Solution:** Contact your IBM Cloud account administrator to:
- Grant you API key creation permissions
- Create an API key on your behalf

### Don't Have AWS Permissions

**Problem:** Can't create EC2 instances

**Solution:** 
- Request EC2 permissions from your AWS administrator
- Use IBM TechZone if you're an IBMer
- Consider using a personal AWS account for testing

### SSH Key Issues

**Problem:** Lost or don't have SSH key

**Solution:**
- Create a new key pair in AWS EC2 console
- Download the `.pem` file immediately (can't download again)
- Set proper permissions: `chmod 400 your-key.pem`
