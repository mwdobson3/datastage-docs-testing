## What You'll Learn

In this tutorial series, you'll learn how to:

- ✅ Install and configure prerequisites (kubectl, Helm, IBM Cloud CLI)
- ✅ Deploy a DataStage Remote Engine on Kubernetes
- ✅ Connect your Remote Engine to IBM Cloud Pak for Data
- ✅ Run your first DataStage job on the Remote Engine
- ✅ Monitor and troubleshoot your deployment

## Tutorial Steps

This tutorial consists of 5 steps:

1. **Install Prerequisites** (5 min) - Set up required tools
2. **Deploy Remote Engine** (10 min) - Install DataStage on Kubernetes
3. **Connect to Cloud Pak for Data** (7 min) - Register your engine
4. **Run Your First Job** (8 min) - Execute a DataStage job
5. **Monitor and Troubleshoot** (10 min) - Verify and debug deployment

## Prerequisites

Before starting this tutorial series, ensure you have:

- **Kubernetes Cluster** - Access to EKS, AKS, GKE, or OpenShift
- **Admin Access** - Ability to install software on your local machine
- **IBM Cloud Pak for Data** - An active instance (trial or production)
- **Basic Kubernetes Knowledge** - Familiarity with pods, deployments, and services

:::tip Estimated Time
The complete tutorial series takes approximately **40 minutes** to complete.

## What is DataStage Anywhere?

DataStage Anywhere allows you to deploy IBM DataStage Remote Engines on any Kubernetes cluster, enabling you to:

- **Run DataStage jobs closer to your data** - Reduce latency and data transfer costs
- **Scale independently** - Add compute resources without affecting Cloud Pak for Data
- **Support hybrid architectures** - Process data in on-premises, cloud, or edge environments
- **Maintain centralized governance** - Manage all engines from Cloud Pak for Data
